# Oden-Simulator
An educational app to simulate eating the traditional Japanese wintertime dish known as oden.

## What is Oden?
Oden is a Japanese soup made with a clear dashi broth and a wide array of solid ingredients. The ingredients are eaten as the main event, in an ensemble cast with the broth playing a background role. Oden warms the body and heart and is the perfect winter delight.

## How to Use
[Click Here](http://oden-simulator.herokuapp.com/) to use the app yourself!

Click the icons to similate adding ingredients to your oden and then eating them. 
* The blue icon adds an item of that ingredient type into the oden.
* The black icon creates a new type of oden ingredient. Please supply a name, image URL and description of this item. The image should be an illustration, in keeping with the theme so far. Only real oden ingredients please! 
* The green icon devours an oden ingredient and moves it to the "Already Eaten" list.
* The red icon removes the ingredient from the "Already Eaten" list. Maybe this ingredient has been fully digested?

You can click the name of any ingredient to see its image and description. 

You can also click the title header for this same "how to use" info.

Please enjoy! 

## Project History

This project was a homework assignment for the Columbia Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, combining our recent topics of MySQL, Express, and Handlebars, as well as MVC application design. The original assignment was to make a burger eating app, but I decided to switch it up and devote an app to my favorite lesser-known (in the US at least) Japanese food! I also gave myself a small challenge by incorporating two database tables instead of one.
